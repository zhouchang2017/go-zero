## Fork之后改了什么？

1. goctl api go 支持time.Time字段
2. 支持action路由生成
3. config改为viper，字段默认值，字段验证有所调整
4. logx日志库有所调整，改为zap

go-zero (listed in CNCF Landscape: [https://landscape.cncf.io/?selected=go-zero](https://landscape.cncf.io/?selected=go-zero)) is a web and rpc framework with lots of builtin engineering practices. It’s born to ensure the stability of the busy services with resilience design and has been serving sites with tens of millions of users for years.

go-zero contains simple API description syntax and code generation tool called `goctl`. You can generate Go, iOS, Android, Kotlin, Dart, TypeScript, JavaScript from .api files with `goctl`.

##  Installation

Run the following command under your project:

```shell
go get -u github.com/zeromicro/go-zero
```

##  Quick Start

1. install goctl

   `goctl`can be read as `go control`. `goctl` means not to be controlled by code, instead, we control it. The inside `go` is not `golang`. At the very beginning, I was expecting it to help us improve productivity, and make our lives easier.

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/zhouchang2017/go-zero.git
   cd go-zero/tools/goctl
   go mod tidy
   go install
   ```

   make sure goctl is executable.

2. create the API file, like greet.api, you can install the plugin of goctl in vs code, api syntax is supported.

   ```go
   type (
     Request {
       Name string `path:"name,options=you|me"` // parameters are auto validated
     }
   
     Response {
       Message string `json:"message"`
     }
   )
   
   @server(
	action: appapiv1
	middleware: AccessLoggerMiddleware,AuthMiddleware
   )
   service greet-api {
     @handler GreetHandler
     get /GreetHandler(Request) returns (Response)
   }
   ```
   
   the .api files also can be generated by goctl, like below:

   ```shell
   goctl api -o greet.api
   ```
   
4. generate the go server-side code

   ```shell
   goctl api go -api greet.api -dir greet
   ```
